# Clocksquared
The Clocksquared word clock, which displays time and birthday messages

## Mechanical design files
The mechanical design files are stored inside the `Mechanical Design` folder. There's a main assembly file, `clocksquared_assy.prt`. Each of the individual components are stored in their own folder. Most files have a PDF file available with a technical drawing of the respective part.

## Source code
There are several source code files. Besides the main `wordclock.ino` file, there are other Arduino programs available for testing purposes or additional functionality (such as scrolling text).
